First I added a cube and built a basic house out fo cubes. Then I learned how to change the time like day, sunset, night, ect. Then I added a cube and turned into a ball and add physics, then I added a ramp so the ball rolls down but there was a problem. The object looked like a ball but it behaved like a cube. So I chnaged its physics to behave like an actuall ball and roll donw normally. Then I started adding some basic enemies using a capsule and a streched cube as it's weapon and then created another flying enemy with a jetpack and turn off its gravity. And finally I added a terrain, chnage its size and added some mountains.
